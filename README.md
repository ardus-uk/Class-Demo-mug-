# Class-Demo-mug
Demo of building a class to model real world objects, in this case the common tea mug

While trying to explain to a friend what a class did and why you might want to use one I used the example of the tea 
(or coffee) mug. Only the __init__ function has been included to keep the code as simple as possible.
